## 1800s Focused

In the prison store, Divers may exchange the tokens given to them for completing missions on "new" equipment.  The prison store always offers some items, but others come and go.  Maybe these items are traded from other prison camps like yours?  Maybe they are dredged up by other Divers?  The guards never say.

The list of items below are what the prison store commonly stocks.  They may stock other items at your GM's discretion.  A list of other items that they may stock can be found in the appendix under mundane items.  Artifacts will only ever be accidentally sold here.
