# Timekeeping
## Simple Realtime
<!---Slot_Name: "Simple_Realtime", Original-->

Time is kept in realtime.  This means that the GM must be well prepared. Favor reacting quickly to reacting correctly. Try to keep the description of rooms to less than 50 words, consider mapping for your players.  Drawing a simple node map (boxes connected by lines) can be enough.

If this is too much pressure or feels unfair to the players, consider using a timer that only runs when the players are acting.

Consider letting the players "Pause" the game to ask about rules.

If an action takes much longer to do in game than it takes to say (e.g. "I build a barricade.")  have the players roll a check to see how fast they work and then give them a faster but appropriate time for a better roll.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Simple_Realtime"-->

## Split Realtime
<!---Slot_Name: "Split_Realtime", Original-->

Time is kept in realtime for the players, but pauses when the GM begins to act.  THis includes describing rooms and deciding outcomes of actions.  Use a chess clock or similar clock for this.  If the players begin to deliberate while the GM is talking/deciding outcomes, the GM should overtly restart the players' clock.

Consider letting the players "Pause" the game to ask about rules.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Split_Realtime"-->

## Tabulated Turn-Based
<!---Slot_Name: "Tabulated_Turn-Based", Original-->

Time is kept only on paper.  Actions are instant (6 seconds), short (1 minutes), or long (10 minutes) by default. 

Examples of time needed for actions
|Instant|Short|Long|
|-|-|-|
|Tying a knot|Forcing a door open|Building a ladder from scrap wood|
|Making an attack|Lighting some kindling with flint and steel|Barricading a door with wood and nails|
|Pausing to listen carefully|Setting a snare/bear trap|Cooking a piece of food|
|Moving quickly through a normal sized room|Barricading a door with furniture or iron spikes|Skimming a book for information|
|Locking a door|Buying things from a store|Moving 1/2 of a cubic yard of soil with a shovel|
|Looting a body|Moving carefully/silently through a normal sized room|Breaking 1/9 of a cubic yard of stone with a hammer and chisel|
|Picking a plant|Searching a normal sized room for traps/secrets|Cutting down a tree|
|Climbing a tree|Applying a bandage|Trapping an animal with bait|

Some actions, like speaking a word or making a gesture, take no time. Similarly, consider not tracking time for Instant actions.

At the GM's discretion players may make an appropriate attribute check to attempt to do something faster.  If they fail the check, then the action takes longer than it would have otherwise.  In general these adjustments should be proportional to the amount of time the task would have originally taken. For example, depending on the outcome of a check: an instant action may take 3 to 12 seconds, a short action may take 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and a long action may take 5 to 20 minutes.  See table below.

|2d10|Instant|Short|Long|
|-|-|-|-|
|2|12s|2m|20m|
|3|12s|2m|20m|
|4|11s|1m 50s|18m 20s|
|5|11s|1m 50s|18m 20s|
|6|10s|1m 40s|16m 40s|
|7|10s|1m 40s|16m 40s|
|8|9s|1m 30s|15m|
|9|8s|1m 20s|13m 20s|
|10|7s|1m 10s|11m 40s|
|11|6s|1m|10m|
|12|5s|50s|8m 20s|
|13|5s|50s|8m 20s|
|14|5s|50s|8m 20s|
|15|4s|40s|6m 40s|
|16|4s|40s|6m 40s|
|17|4s|40s|6m 40s|
|18|3s|30s|5m|
|19|3s|30s|5m|
|20|3s|30s|5m|

For the above table: s = seconds, m = minutes 

Before rolling to see how quickly they complete a task, the players may state a maximum time that they would spend on the task. If they roll a time less than their stated maximum, they complete the task in the rolled time. If the check results in a time longer than their stated maximum: the time is wasted, the players fail to complete the task, and the task must be started again from scratch.

# The Curse

Different ways to calculate how and when Divers receieve mutations

## Simple Cursed on Surfacing
<!---Slot_Name: "Simple_Cursed_on_Surfacing", Original-->

The ruin is pervaded by a curse that would mutate beyond recognition any living thing that tries to leave it.  Luckily, each team of divers are given an artifact, a small Bell, that can hold off this ill effect as they surface.  But be wary, the power of the Bell is finite.  Even with a Bell, the longer a diver spends below, the more twisted they are upon their return.

The following effects occur to characters as they ride the finial lift back to the surface.

Upon returning with a Bell:
- Less than 60 min below leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 60 min below gives the diver one mild mutation.
- More than 90 min below gives the diver two mild mutations.
- More than 120 min below gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 150 min below gives the diver two severe mutations.
- Spending longer than 180 min below results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.

Upon returning without a Bell:
- Less than 15 min below leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 15 min below gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 30 min below results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Cursed_on_Surfacing"-->

## Graded Cursed on Surfacing
<!---Slot_Name: "Simple_Cursed_on_Surfacing", Original-->

The ruin is pervaded by a curse that would mutate beyond recognition any living thing that tries to leave it.  Luckily, each team of divers are given an artifact, a small Bell, that can hold off this ill effect as they surface.  But be wary, the power of the Bell is finite.  Even with a Bell, the longer a diver spends below, the more twisted they are upon their return.

The deeper a Diver goes into the Ruin, the more quickly they accumulate curse.  Divers often speak of being laden with too much curse as being "hotter" and thus curse accumulation is measured in degrees.  The accumulated curse is only shed when the Divers return to the surface.

|Depth|Degrees per Minute|
|-|-|
|1|0.5|
|2|0.75|
|3|1|
|4|1.25|
|5|1.5|

Note that this requires carefully tabulating of how long players spend at each depth.

The following effects occur to characters as they ride the finial lift back to the surface.

Upon returning with a Bell:
- Less than 60 degrees leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 60 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation.
- More than 90 degrees gives the diver two mild mutations.
- More than 120 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 150 degrees gives the diver two severe mutations.
- More than 180 degrees results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.

Upon returning without a Bell:
- Less than 15 degrees leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 15 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 30 degrees results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Simple_Cursed_on_Surfacing"-->

## Graded Cursed on Ascending
<!---Slot_Name: "Simple_Cursed_on_Ascending", Original-->

The ruin is pervaded by a curse that would mutate beyond recognition any living thing that tries to leave it.  Luckily, each team of divers are given an artifact, a small Bell, that can hold off this ill effect as they surface.  But be wary, the power of the Bell is finite.  Even with a Bell, the longer a diver spends at a depth, the more twisted they are as they try to return to the depth above.

Divers often speak of being laden with too much curse as being "hotter" and thus curse accumulation is often measured in degrees.  Each different depth is said to give curse of a different color.  When a diver is at a particular depth, they accumulate curse of that depth's color as well as curse of all colors of all depths that are above them.  Going deeper does not increase the rate at whch Divers accumulate curse of colors from deptsh above them.  For example: White curse is always accumulated at 1 degree per minute.

|Depth|Color|Degrees per Minute|
|-|-|-|
|1|White|1|
|2|Green|1.5|
|3|Blue|2|
|4|Red|2.5|
|5|Black|3|

The following effects occur to Divers as they rise from one depth to the next based on how much curse of the lower depth's color they have accumulated.  Suffering the effect clears the Diver of all curse of that color. Note that this requires carefully tabulating of how long players spend at each depth.

Upon ascending with a Bell:
- Less than 60 degrees leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 60 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation.
- More than 90 degrees gives the diver two mild mutations.
- More than 120 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 150 degrees gives the diver two severe mutations.
- More than 180 degrees results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.

Upon ascending without a Bell:
- Less than 15 degrees leaves the diver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 15 degrees gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 30 degrees results in three severe mutations and total madness upon return.
