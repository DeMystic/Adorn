# Adorn
Adorn is a standard for building modular homebrew TTRPGs with a focus on sharing content with other games as freely as possible without compromising on attribution.

If you want to get started you can have a look at the quick reference or jump right into the [Full Standard](https://github.com/DeMystic/Adorn/blob/main/adorn_format_standard.md)

To get you started, Adorn also provides:
- A Style Guide for suggested formatting for your game and module files 
- A Sample Game file
- A Sample Module File
