# Bounce Dive
<!---Slot_Name: "Intro", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Ice_Prison_Intro", Link: "XXX"-->

You are a hapless prisoner, locked in an icy camp, far from anywhere.

You don't break rocks, you don't mine salt... You Dive.

But not into water. No... Divers dredge the depths of a twisted ruin.

## The Ruin

The twisted rooms and the creatures therein them seem out of place and even out of time.

Artifacts the Divers find there have strange powers that defy the imagination.

A cloying curse pervades the space: When divers linger too long they find themselves horribly twisted as they resurface.

## Your Goals

Find the artifacts demanded of you by your jailers.

Use the tokens the jailers reward you with to resupply.

Don't get caught smuggling artifacts past the jailers.

_Survive..._
<!---/Slot_Name: "Intro"-->

# Who Are You?
<!---Slot_Name: "Attributes", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Bounce_Dive_Default_Six", Link: "XXX"-->

Your character has six attributes relevant to your dive:

- **Strength** is for: carrying more things, running fast, moving heavy things, etc...
  - Anyone can push a small wooden crate, few people can bust down a hardwood door in a single blow.
- **Dexterity** is for: dodging attacks, climbing, reflexes, etc...
  - Anyone can climb a rope. Few people can scale a sheer stone wall.
- **Endurance** is for: surviving attacks, resisting ill physical effects, toughness, etc...
  - Anyone can stand a slight chill. Few can survive on a glacier for hours without proper gear.
- **Charisma** is for: making people/creatures like you, persuading, resisting persuasion, etc...
  - Anyone can calm a starving monster with food. Few can charm a sphinx.
- **Awareness** is for: moving silently, seeing hidden creatures, noticing lies, etc...
  - Anyone can spot a hiding child. Few can see through the camouflage of a giant moth.
- **Craftiness** is for: makeshift construction, misappropriating supplies, understanding mechanisms, etc...
  - Anyone can tie a knot strong enough to hold their own weight. Few can rig a pulley system out of trash. 

Any other attributes are up to you and the GM.

When making a character, you may assign the following numbers as you please, one to each attribute.  Higher is better.

|3|2|2|1|1|0|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|

A 0 is slightly below average, a 1 is average, a 2 is good and a 3 is exceptional.  These values will be used in Checks to determine what happens when you attempt to do **difficult** things.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Attributes"-->

# What Can You Do?
<!---Slot_Name: "Checks", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Checks_d10", Link: "XXX"-->

A Diver can attempt almost any action but will sometimes need to perform an attribute check to see if they succeed.

To roll a check, roll 2d10 and add a relevant attribute.  If the result is equal or greater than a target value decided by the GM, your action succeeds.

Before you roll, the GM will decide this target value based on the difficulty of the action and the specific situation you're in. (e.g. it's harder to eves drop near a rushing river vs in an empty cave)  They may choose to not tell you the target number directly, but will often give you a hint about how difficult the action is likely to be.

Your GM will only have you roll a check whenever you want to do something that is both not trivially easy and has high stakes.  Almost all other actions are expected to succeed given enough time and effort and don't require a check.

Example difficulty values:

|Target|Difficulty|
|-|-|
|8|Almost trivial for anyone|
|11|Even odds for the naive|
|14|Even odds for an expert|
|17|Challenging for an expert|
|20|Nearly impossible for a novice|
|23|Nearly impossible for anyone|

# Equipment
## Starting Equipment
<!---Slot_Name: "Starting Equipment", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Gonzo_Mundane", Link: "XXX"-->

The guards give new Divers a small backpack full of starting equipment before their first dive.  On future dives, Divers have to buy new equipment by spending tokens given to them for retrieving Artifacts and completing missions.

To find your starting equipment roll a d20 three times and look at the corresponding equipment on the list below.  Pick the result you like best.

|d20 Value|Equipment|
|-|-|
|1|Dagger, Shuttered lantern, Lock pick set, Vial of acid|
|2|Dagger, Smoke bomb, Hooded cloak|

*These items are heavy and may take up more space in your inventory.  See the next section for details.

See the mundane items section in the appendix for the full list of items and some relevant details.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Starting Equipment"-->

## Shop Equipment
<!---Slot_Name: "Shop Equipment", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Gonzo_Mundane_Shop", Link: "XXX"-->

In the prison store, Divers may exchange the tokens given to them for completing missions on "new" equipment.  The prison store always offers some items, but others come and go.  Maybe these items are traded from other prison camps like yours?  Maybe they are dredged up by other Divers?  The guards never say.

The list of items below are what the prison store commonly stocks.  They may stock other items at your GM's discretion.  A list of other items that they may stock can be found in the appendix under mundane items.  Artifacts will only ever be accidentally sold here.

### Weapons and Ammunition
|Price|Item|
|-|-|
|5|knife (d4 damage)|
|5|club* (d6 damage)|
|30|long sword* (d8 damage)|
|5|slingshot (d4 damage)|
|20|bow (d6 damage)|
|5|quiver of 10 arrows*|
|30|box of 10 bullets|

*These items are heavy and may take up more space in your inventory.  See the Inventory section for details.


### Tools
|Price|Item|
|-|-|
|10|flint and steel|
|5|tinder box|
|5|torch*|
|15|flask of lamp/lantern oil (1 hour)|
|5|hammer|
|10|bag of 5 pitons (iron spikes)|
|20|rope* (30m)|
|10|empty flask|
|5|small bag|
|5|hide and cloth clothing|
|5|dried food|

*These items are heavy and may take up more space in your inventory.  See the Inventory section for details.

### Armor

Armor is not sold by default, but may be available on occasion.  All armor has an armor rating that indicates how much protection it gives the wearer. See the Combat section for more details.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Shop Equipment"-->

# Inventory
<!---Slot_Name: "Inventory", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Slots", Link: "XXX"-->

A Diver's inventory is mde up of slots.  Most items take up one slot, items that are heavy take up two slots.  Some items may take up more than two slots, but this will be explicitly stated if it is the case.

Small items will often fit into a bag or case of 10 or 20.  These small containers often take up a single slot or two slots.

A Diver has a number of slots equal to five plus their Strength.

If you carry more than 5 + STR it is assumed that you are lugging things around in your arms. So, you will not be able to take any actions besides moving in combat, and your GM may give you a penalty on checks involving moving fast or gracefully.  You can carry up to an absolute max of 6 + 2 x STR slots worth of items.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Inventory"-->

# Distance
<!---Slot_Name: "Distance", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Close_Near_Far", Link: "XXX"-->

In the ruins, distance is broken down into three relevant ranges:
- Close (less than 2m* away)
  - You can touch it
  - You can hit it with a melee weapon
- Near (In the same room and within 30m*)
  - It is a stone throw away
  - You can hit it with a ranged weapon
- Far: (more than one room away or greater than 30m* away)
  - It is farther than a stone throw away
  - You cant hit it with conventional weapons

*a meter is just a yard, if you want to use freedom units

In one combat turn, a player may move from one distance range to an adjacent one (e.g. Close to Near, not Close to Far).  Note that it may take longer to move from Far to Near depending on how far away the player is.  How to handle this is up to the GM, see Fleeing and Chasing below for some ideas.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Distance"-->

# Encountering Creatures

Sometime Divers run into the denizens of the ruin.  They can be twisted creatures of nightmares, mundane animals, or strangely relatable humans.

## Surprise
<!---Slot_Name: "Surprise", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Check_vs_Check_Surprise", Link: "XXX"-->

When you enter a room with a creature in it or a creature enters the room that you are in, each member of both parties first roll an awareness check to see if one party surprises the other. The highest roll from each party is compared, and the party that rolled the highest gets to act once before the other party is aware.  

The GM may grant bonuses or penalties to checks based on actions taken by either side to be: extra sneaky, extra noticeable, less weary, or extra weary.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Surprise"-->

## Reaction
<!---Slot_Name: "Reaction_Rolls", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "DM_Dice_Hybrid_Reaction", Link: "XXX"-->

Some creatures will always be hostile to Divers when they meet them, some creatures will be neutral towards them, and some may even be happy to see them. If the GM has not determined this beforehand, they may do so in the moment by rolling a d6:

|d6|Outcome|
|-|-|
|1-4|Hostile|
|5|Neutral|
|6|Friendly|

While some creatures will be totally fixed in their initial impression, the GM may allow you to make a Charisma check to change the monster's initial reaction towards you.  the default target for this check is 16, but it may be adjusted by the GM based on the specific creature and the current circumstances.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Reaction_Rolls"-->

## Combat

### Health
<!---Slot_Name: "Health", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Simple_health", Link: "XXX"-->
A Diver's life in metered out in HP (Health Points).

As a Diver takes physical damage, they run out of HP.

When a Diver runs out of HP, they are dead.

A Diver recovers their HP when they finally have time to rest back on the surface.

A Diver has a max HP equal to four plus twice their Endurance.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Health"-->

### Initiative
<!---Slot_Name: "Initiative", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Group_Initiative", Link: "XXX"-->
When you enter combat with a creature or group of creatures in the ruin, the group that won the surprise roll gets the first turn.

Combat is split into alternating turns between the group of players and the group of non-player creatures.  All members of a given group can take actions on their turn in whatever order they please.  One pair of turns (an enemy turn + a player turn) is sometimes called a round.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Initiative"-->

### Combat Actions
<!---Slot_Name: "Combat", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Damage_Dodge_Combat", Link: "XXX"-->

On their turn a player or creature can move once and take one action.  This action can be making an attack or doing something else that would take a similar amount of time.

Attacking:
- The player or creature picks a target player or creature within range as their target and then rolls the damage die associated with their weapon.  The creature takes that much damage. If the attacked creature is armored, they may subtract their armor rating from the incoming damage.

Dodging:
- After the damage die has been rolled, a creature or player may choose to dodge the incoming damage.  In this case, they forgo their next action (so, on their next turn they can not attack or take another action, but can still move) and subtract their Reflex from the incoming attack. A given creature or player can only do this once per round.

Moving:
- If a player is not within melee range of a target, they can not make melee attacks. The player may, however, move into melee range of the enemy they wish to attack and then make their attack. See the Distance section for more details.
- If a player is within melee range of a hostile, they can not make range attacks.  The player may, however, move away from enemies at the beginning of their turn and then make a ranged attack.  See the Distance section for more details.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Combat"-->

## Fleeing and Chasing
<!---Slot_Name: "Fleeing", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Close_Near_Far.Check_vs_Check_Fleeing", Link: "XXX"-->

This is one way to handle running from combat.  Knowing when to disengage is critical to surviving the ruin.

If you want to flee combat, you must try to outrun your enemy.  Note that most creatures are highly territorial and wont chase you further than a few rooms.

When fleeing or chasing, all members of the party fleeing and the party chasing roll Chase Checks (Strength checks) to see how fast they can go. Each party takes the lowest value rolled by a member of that party as the check for that party.  The party with the highest Chase Check changes the distance between the two parties in their favor by one unit. So Close could become Near, or Near could become Far.  If the parties are already far apart, then the distance continues to change in 30m increments. 

Attacks can be made by Fleeing or Chasing creatures if the attacker is in range after resolving the Chase Check. Attacking during a chase gives the attacker a -3 penalty to their next Chase Check.  The chasing creatures also take a -3 to their next Chase Check if they choose to dodge an incoming attack from the fleeing party. Members of the Fleeing party may dodge incoming attacks without incurring any penalty.

The case ends when:
- One party gives up
- The fleeing party is cornered
- The Fleeing party has broken line of sight and successfully hidden from the chasers
  - By losing them in the twisting passages of the ruins
  - By hiding (see the Hiding section)

If individual members of a party in a chase decide to separate from their slower companions take higher values if they want to separate from their allies, the result can be very situation dependant. For example, does a fast enemy choose to chase down the slowest member of the main group of players, or do they skirt around them and try to catch the fastest? It's up to the DM to decide what to do in this case.

If the terrain is rough or tricky to navigate, the GM may have you use another check like Dexterity or Awareness instead of Strength.

Very large or heavy enemies may get a penalty to chasing.  This is up to the DM.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Fleeing"-->

## Hiding
<!---Slot_Name: "Hiding", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Simple_Hiding", Link: "XXX"-->

To hide you must first not have line of sight to the enemy you are hiding from and second you must have an appropriate hiding spot (e.g. a closet or a pile of crates).

To hide, you roll an Awareness check (the GM may give you a bonus based on your hiding spot) when an enemy enters the same space as you, they also roll an Awareness check.  They may get a bonus if they are actively searching for you, or a penalty if they are not.  If they beat your check, they find you.  If they don't, they likely move on unless they have some specific reason to expect you there.  If they have reason to continue searching the space, they may make a few checks before continuing onwards.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Hiding"-->

# The Curse
<!---Slot_Name: "The_Curse", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Cursed_on_Return", Link: "XXX"-->

The longer a diver spends in the ruin, the more they are punished by its curse.  Returning to the surface after spending too long below causes strange mutations to warp the diver.

Upon their return:
- Less than 60 min below leaves the fiver nauseous but unchanged.
- More than 60 min below gives the diver one mild mutation.
- More than 90 min below gives the diver two mild mutations.
- More than 120 min below gives the diver one mild mutation and one severe mutation.
- More than 150 min below gives the diver two severe mutations.
- Spending longer than 180 min below results in death upon return.

Mild mutations are generally slightly inconvenient, but some can be quite bad for some divers.  They are rarely positive.

Severe mutations are generally debilitating.  Players who receive sever mutations may consider retiring their character afterwards.

Mutations can be determined by rolling on the mutation tables in the appendix.

<!---/Slot_Name: "The_Curse"-->

<!---Slot_Name: "Time_Keeping", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Simple_Realtime", Link: "XXX"-->
Time is kept in realtime.  This means that the GM must be well prepared. Favor reacting quickly to reacting correctly. Try to keep the description of rooms to less than 50 words, consider mapping for your players.  Drawing a simple node map (boxes connected by lines) can be enough.

If this is too much pressure or feels unfair to the players, consider using a timer that only runs when the players are acting.

Consider letting the players "Pause" the game to ask about rules.

If an action takes much longer to do in game than it takes to say (e.g. "I build a barricade.")  have the players roll a check to see how fast they work and then give them a 
<!---/Slot_Name: "Simple_Realtime"-->

## Acclimation
<!---Slot_Name: "Acclimation", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Simple_Acclimation", Link: "XXX"-->

Each time a diver spends more than 45 consecutive min in the ruin, they become more acclimated to the curse.

Acclimation extends all times required for the various levels of the curse to take effect by 15 min.  This includes the time till the next acclimation increment.

The longest time extension physically attainable by acclimation is 2 hours.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Acclimation"-->

# Embarking
<!---Slot_Name: "Embarking", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Ice_Prison_Embark", Link: "XXX"-->

The entire camp sits next do an ancient dead ice field.

The entry to the ruin is a gaping crevasse in the ice.  A steam powered winch lowers a cage that can fit 8 people down into the ruin.  It descends out of the bottom of a huge spoked wheelhouse on the ice.  A lever in the cage lets you call for it to be lifted by the operator at the top.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Embarking"-->

## Mundane Items

Here are a few lists of items that the characters may find in the general store or in the ruin.
It is not exhaustive, and similarly not all items are expected to be in the shop at all times.  One way to use these tables it to roll for a few of these items to be temporarily added to the shop each time the players visit

### Weapons and Ammunition

Consider making weapons ruin loot only.  If you stock them in your shop, consider rolling a d100 to pick which one and only picking one if the roll is 20 or less.

Conversely, ammunition may take more careful balancing. Consider always stocking ammunition that the party has a weapon to use, while only rarely or never stocking things like bombs and flashbangs.

### Armor

Note that when general, lighter and stronger armor should be rarer.  It's generally a good idea to not include anything other than leather or padded armor in the shop.

Armor makes great ruin loot, but If you do want to sock armor occasionally in your shop, consider rolling a d100 then stocking leather or padded on rolls less than 20 and chain or banded on rolls of 1 or 2 (if at all).

### Battery Operated
These items are definitely not of this world.

Consider having batteries die quickly in the ruin (e.g. all batteries brought into the ruin die after one dive, weather the party uses them or not.). If you do this, stock one or two batteries in your shop before each dive and charge ~20 tokens for one.

Also consider making these items ruin loot only.  If you stock them in your shop, consider rolling a d100 to pick which one and only picking one if the roll is 10 or less

## Artifacts

Artifacts are items that appear to be mundane items but have some kind of otherworldly properties.  They are generated by rolling four times on the following table and combining the results.

Feel free to roll on any of the longer lists of items in the Mundane items section instead of the first column.

Its up to the GM to make and interpret the results in a way that is fun without being too game breaking.  For example the GM may add extra limitations on the duration of the effect or the number of uses.
