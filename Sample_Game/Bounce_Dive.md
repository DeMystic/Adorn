# Bounce Dive
<!---Slot_Name: "Intro", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Ice_Prison_Intro", Link: "XXX"-->

You are a hapless prisoner, locked in an icy camp, far from anywhere.

You don't break rocks, you don't mine salt... You Dive.

But not into water. No, you dredge the depths of an impossible ruin.

## The Ruin

The twisted rooms and the creatures therein them seem out of place and even out of time.

Artifacts you find there have strange powers that defy the imagination.

A cloying curse pervades the space: When divers linger too long they find themselves horribly twisted as they resurface.

## Your Goals

Find the artifacts demanded of you by your jailers.

Use the tokens the jailers reward you with to resupply.

Don't get caught smuggling artifacts past the jailers.

_Survive..._

# Who Are You?
<!---Slot_Name: "Attributes", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Bounce_Dive_Default_Six", Link: "XXX"-->

Your character has six attributes relevant to your dive:

- **Strength** is for: carrying more things, running fast, moving heavy things, etc...
  - Anyone can push a small wooden crate, few people can bust down a hardwood door in a single blow.
- **Dexterity** is for: dodging attacks, climbing, reflexes, etc...
  - Anyone can climb a rope. Few people can scale a sheer stone wall.
- **Endurance** is for: surviving attacks, resisting ill physical effects, toughness, etc...
  - Anyone can stand a slight chill. Few can survive on a glacier for hours without proper gear.
- **Charisma** is for: making people/creatures like you, persuading, resisting persuasion, etc...
  - Anyone can calm a starving monster with food. Few can charm a sphinx.
- **Awareness** is for: moving silently, seeing hidden creatures, noticing lies, etc...
  - Anyone can spot a hiding child. Few can see through the camouflage of a giant moth.
- **Craftiness** is for: makeshift construction, misappropriating supplies, understanding mechanisms, etc...
  - Anyone can tie a knot strong enough to hold their own weight. Few can rig a pulley system out of trash. 

Any other attributes are up to you and the GM.

When making a character, you may assign the following numbers as you please, one to each attribute.  Higher is better.

|3|2|2|1|1|0|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|

A 0 is slightly below average, a 1 is average, a 2 is good and a 3 is exceptional.  These values will be used in Checks to determine what happens when you attempt to do **difficult** things.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Attributes"-->

# What Can You Do?
<!---Slot_Name: "Checks", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Checks_d10", Link: "XXX"-->

You can attempt almost any action but will sometimes need to perform an attribute check to see if you succeed.

To roll a check, roll 2d10 and add a relevant attribute.  If the result is equal or greater than a target value decided by the GM, your action succeeds.

Before you roll, the GM will decide this target value based on the difficulty of the action and the specific situation you're in. (e.g. it's harder to eves drop near a rushing river vs in an empty cave)  They may choose to not tell you the target number directly, but will often give you a hint about how difficult the action is likely to be.

Your GM will only have you roll a check whenever you want to do something that is both not trivially easy and has high stakes.  Almost all other actions are expected to succeed given enough time and effort and don't require a check.

Example difficulty values:

|Target|Difficulty|
|-|-|
|8|Almost trivial for anyone|
|11|Even odds for the naive|
|14|Even odds for an expert|
|17|Challenging for an expert|
|20|Nearly impossible for a novice|
|23|Nearly impossible for anyone|

# Equipment
## Starting Equipment
<!---Slot_Name: "Starting Equipment", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Gonzo_Mundane", Link: "XXX"-->

The guards offer you a small backpack full of starting equipment before your first decent.  On future decents you will have to spend tokens given to you for retrieving Artifacts on new equipment.

To find your starting equipment roll a 3d20 and take the corresponding equipment.  Look at the table below for the three corresponding lists of equipment and pick the one you like best.

|d20 Value|Equipment|

See the mundane items section in the appendix for the full list of items and some relevant details.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Starting Equipment"-->

## Shop Equipment
<!---Slot_Name: "Shop Equipment", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Gonzo_Mundane_Shop", Link: "XXX"-->

In the prison store, you may exchange the tokens given to you for completing missions for equipment that may be used on the next one.  The prison store always offers some items, but others come and go.  Maybe these items are traded from other prison camps like yours?  the guards never say.

The list of items below are what the prison store commonly stocks.  They may stock other items at your GM's discretion.  A list of other items that they may stock can be found in the appendix under mundane items.  Artifacts will only ever be accidentally sold here.

### Weapons and Ammunition
|Price|Item|
|-|-|
|5|knife (d6 damage)|
|5|club (d6 damage)|
|20|sword* (d8 damage)|
|5|slingshot (d6 damage)|
|20|bow* (d8 damage)|
|5|quiver* of 10 arrows|
|20|box of 10 bullets|

*These items are heavy and may take up more space in your inventory.  See the Inventory section for details.


### Tools
|Price|Item|
|-|-|
|10|flint and steel|
|5|tinder box|
|5|torch*|
|15|flask of lamp/lantern oil (1 hour)|
|5|hammer|
|10|bag of 5 pitons (iron spikes)|
|20|rope* (30m)|
|10|empty flask|
|5|small bag|
|5|hide and cloth clothing|
|5|dried food|

*These items are heavy and may take up more space in your inventory.  See the Inventory section for details.

<!---/Slot_Name: "Starting Equipment"-->

# Inventory
<!---Slot_Name: "Inventory", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Slots", Link: "XXX"-->

Your inventory is mde up of slots.  Most items take up one slot, items that are heavy take up two slots.  Some items may take up more than two slots, but this will be explicitly stated if it is the case.

Small items will often fit into a bag or case of 10 or 20.  These small containers often take up a single slot or two slots.

You have a number of slots equal to five plus your strength.

If you carry more than 5 + STR it is assumed that you are lugging things around in your arms. So, you will not be able to take any actions besides moving in combat, and your GM may give you a penalty on checks involving moving fast or gracefully.  You can carry up to an absolute max of 6 + 2 x STR slots worth of items.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Slots"-->

# Encountering Creatures

Sometime you run into the denizens of the ruin.  They can be twisted creatures of nightmares, mundane animals, or strangely relatable humans.

## Surprise
<!---Slot_Name: "Surprise", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "Check_vs_Check_Surprise", Link: "XXX"-->

When you enter a room with a creature in it or a creature enters the room that you are in, each member of both parties first roll an awareness check to see if one party surprises the other. The highest roll from each party is compared, and the party that rolled the highest gets to act once before the other party is aware.  

The GM may grant bonuses or penalties to checks based on actions taken by either side to be: extra sneaky, extra noticeable, less weary, or extra weary.
<!---/Slot_Name: "Surprise"-->

## Reaction
<!---Slot_Name: "Reaction_Rolls", Copied_From, Source_Slot: "DM_Dice_Hybrid_Reaction", Link: "XXX"-->

Some creatures will always be hostile to you when you meet them, some creatures will be neutral towards you, and some may even be happy to see you. If the GM has not determined this beforehand, they may do so in the moment by rolling a d6:

|d6|Outcome|
|-|-|
|1-4|Hostile|
|5|Neutral|
|6|Friendly|

While some creatures will be totally fixed in their initial impression, the GM may allow you to make a charisma check to change the monster's initial reaction towards you.  the default target for this check is 16, but it may be adjusted by the GM based on the specific creature and the current circumstances.

## Mundane Items

Here are a few lists of items that the characters may find in the general store or in the ruin.
It is not exhaustive, and similarly not all items are expected to be in the shop at all times.  One way to use these tables it to roll for a few of these items to be temporarily added to the shop each time the players visit

### Battery Operated

## Artifacts

Artifacts are items that appear to be mundane items but have some kind of otherworldly properties.  They are generated by rolling four times on the following table and combining the results.

Feel free to roll on any of the longer lists of items in the Mundane items section instead of the first column.

Its up to the GM to make and interpret the results in a way that is fun without being too game breaking.  For example the GM may add extra limitations on the duration of the effect or the number of uses.
